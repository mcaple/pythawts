## About

The idea of this documentation is to give myself an opportunity to create some documentation for a package that will attempt to give clarity on how all my Python projects should be implemented. It is a collection of my current best practices along with some stuff I find useful along the way. It is also the first time I have used Sphinx and it is always better to have something to do to learn a project.

The repository is ultimately used to build static github pages that can be used for future reference. The static pages are located at https://mcaple.github.io/pythawts/
